# Startup-Location-Analysis-Tableau
Analyzed nationwide stores performance and marketing spend using Tableau. 

In this role, I was given the task of being a Data Scientist working for a laundry pickup service startup We Wash You Sleep. They are a small company and they cannot compete with the big players in major cities. The company strategy is to build a vast network in the smaller cities across the United States. 

The company has 140 locations and have recently opened stores in 10 new cities. Additionally the company has two seperate sales regions. 

###Goal of the Project 
1. Identify which of the two sales regions is performing better (outperform the other in 2 of the 3 metrics): 
  - AVG revenue per city 
  - AVG marketing spend per city (less is better) 
  - AVG ROMI per city (revenue/marketing spend) 
  
2. Identify which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the company to invest more of its funds into marketing.
